This repository is my work for the Exploration Activity #1 of CS2613 - Fall 2023 - University of New Brunswick. This is forked from a Github profile created by Github Classroom.

**NOTE:** I essentially followed this amazing [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL42MzI01SYj7unM-kMN1nf70smlIsLDc0) by Justin Robertson and added more features like random obstacles and taylored the aesthetics of the game to my style.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First, if you haven't already, you will need to install Python on your machine. You can find out more on how to download and install Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, you are required to install the Pyglet library to run the program.

- Go to Command Prompt and enter the following:
```
py -m pip install pyglet
```

After the code is executed successfully, you are now ready to clone the repository and run the game!

## How to play

After launching the game, simply start by pressing any of the arrow keys on your keyboard to move.

Your objective is to eat as many üçé's as you can while avoiding collision with the obsticles and the edges of the screen. Good luck!
